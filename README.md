# SidPlayerPro

This is SidPlayerPro, my first iOS (back then called iPhone OS) project.
It's very old and I did know nothing about Objective-C and OS X back then,
so please bear with me :)

It should still compile and run, but will look pretty strange since it hasn't been
updated for years. It is provided here solely for reference.

See http://www.vanille.de/rfc-future-sidplayer-modplayer-pokeyplayer-ios/ for more info.

Have fun!
