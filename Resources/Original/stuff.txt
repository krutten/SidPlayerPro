the buttons have two states as the old ones, also i made them with and without the text, you can use any of them but if you choose to make the text by software then change the color to black
the background image maybe looks a bit simple but i didnt wanted to saturate it with too many things :/
hope the spaslscreen is ok, i just had no idea of what to do
aaaaand i didnt changed the icons on the player and some others cos i think they already look nice (seriously... is not as if im lazy and dont want to change them xD)
