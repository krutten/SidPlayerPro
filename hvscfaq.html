</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
HVSC is the ultimate SID tune collection featuring over 30,000 popular
and requested SIDs from the Commodore 64.  The collection includes SIDs
(aka C64 music) from games, demos, intros, etc. HVSC has been in the
making for six years and is the result of many contributors.

[2] What software and hardware do I need to play the tunes in HVSC?
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
Lucky for you, there are many devoted SID fans throughout the world. Many
people have created or ported SID emulators to various OSes. To name a
few: Win95, Win3.1, Linux, MSDOS, MacOS, AmigaOS, Atari Falcon, BeOS,
OS/2, etc.  For a complete list of which OSs are supported, see the HVSC web
page.  You can also listen to the SIDs in HVSC on a real C64 with Real SID
Play.  More information is available on the HVSC web page.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
As for additional hardware, you only need a sound card. 
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
In addition to using your home computer, there are hardware devices out
there that utilize the SID chip itself in conjunction with your sound
card.  See <a href="http://www.hardsid.com" target="_blank">http://www.hardsid.com</a> and <a href="http://www.sidstation.com" target="_blank">http://www.sidstation.com</a>

[3] Isn't Commodore C64 music just silly beep-blop music?
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
Absolutely not!  Although the C64 went into production in 1983, do not
underestimate the C64's technology.  In fact, <a href="http://www.byte.com/art/9509/sec7/art9.htm" target="_blank">Byte Magazine named the C64's</a>
<a href="http://www.byte.com/art/9509/sec7/art9.htm" target="_blank">Sound Interface Device (SID) as one of the 20 most important chips</a> in
computer history along side the PowerPC, Intel 8086, and Pentium.  After all,
there has to be a reason why there are so many SID fans.  You should note that
there were two distinctive regions for SID music, America and Europe.
American SID music is on average lower in quality compared to European SID
music.  This is not to say that American SID music is crap, but if you are
judging SID music based on the American SID music you have heard, I can
understand partially why you might think SID music is silly.  Why is American
SID music lacking compared to European SID music?  Mainly this has to do with
much information sharing related to the SID composing tools in Europe (not to
mention some theft as well).  The best way for you to determine if SID music
is or isn't for you is to listen to some of the best.  Take a listen to some
Hubbard, Galway, Daglish, Gray (Fred and Matt) and Tel.  If you do not like 
any of those artists, then there is a strong chance you will not like any 
SID music.
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
You should also note that C64 music has been played not just on specialist
radio shows like the KDVS 6581 SID show (now sadly no longer with us) but
also on Swedish national television.  So much for silly beep-blop then :)

[4] Which tunes are added to HVSC, and why?</font></font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
HVSC adds music from games, and C64 scene programs (whether they be
from demos, stand alone music packs, or disk magazines) which have
been released into the public domain.  However, we do not normally add
any Compute! Gazette tunes (see <a href="#5">[5]</a>).  Thus, if a tune has been released
publically including C64 FTP or WWW sites, this means it also allows
for any other public collection such as HVSC to place it in their
collections as well using the same unrestricted and free ethics that
public domain software allows.  We do this so that HVSC serves
as an archive, not just for the SID fans, but for the composers as well
if they ever need to refer to their work.  There are also some
previously unreleased tunes by composers which HVSC also has
(such as /Gray_Fred/Sled.sid), where the HVSC Crew strictly asks
for _composer permission_ before releasing such.
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font color="#00FF00" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><a name="5"></a>
[5] Why aren't there any Compute Gazette SIDPlayer tunes in HVSC?
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
Mainly, because on average they do not sound as good as non-SIDPlayer tunes.
SIDPlayer was a public domain SID composer and player available in the early
'80s on the C64. The tool was predominately used by Americans and has a
strong following among the public domain audience.  SIDPlayer tunes are
usually follow by a &quot;.mus&quot; and can be found on some C64 ftp sites.
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
The best Compute! Gazette SID tune collection HVSC knows of is maintained by
Peter Weighill and the latest version can be found here:

(note: do not confuse SIDPlayer with SIDPlay. SIDPlay is a SID emulator
where as SIDPlayer is a SID player for the C64.  Confusion is easy when there
is SIDPlay, PLAYSID (Amiga), SIDPlayer (C64), Real SIDPlay (C64), etc.)

[6] What is the SID Tune Information List (STIL)?</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
The <a href="http://www.stil.c64.org/" target="_blank">STIL</a> is basically a text file which contains general information about
the SIDs in HVSC.  Such information includes the original composer's name,
defects in certain tunes, interesting trivia, etc.  Consult the STIL FAQ
for more information.  Hopefully your SID emulator has the option to
display the STIL information for the current playing SID tune.

[7] What is PSIDv2NG?
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
PSIDv2NG (PSID format v2, Next Generation) was invented by Simon White and
Dag Lem and is an extension of the Playsid V2 file format.  It takes
advantage of some free bytes in the header and allows for the following
situations (the first one was already in the existing PSID v2 format):
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
* the SID file has a standalone player or is a Compute! Gazette
   SIDplayer tune
* whether the SID file is C64 compatible or specific to the old
   PlaySID formats
* whether the SID file is for NTSC (eg: USA) or PAL (eg: Europe) TV
   formats
* SID chip selection, 6581 (old) or 8580 (new) SID chip
* relocation fields, required to support a real C64(emulator) where
  additional code must be placed in C64 ram to play the SID tune.
<br>
All the above means that it also allows for better compatibility with
<br>
a real Commodore 64 so you can play the tunes on the real thing (see 
<br>
also RSID below)
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
It also has the added advantage of being backwards compatible with
most SID tunes, so that older SID emulators can still play them, but
to take advantage of the features of PSID v2NG, you are highly
recommended to use SID emulators based on the latest libsidplay2
emulation engine (for example, 
<a href="http://www.d.kth.se/%7Ed93-alo/c64/spw/" target="_blank">
Sidplay2 for Windows
</a>
) to play SIDs in HVSC.
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
RSID is an extension of the PSID v2NG format, introduced in HVSC 5.1.
RSID is for those rips that require strict C64 compliance, and also
ensure that older SID emulators do not lock up when attempting to play
these SIDs. It does this by having &quot;RSID&quot; in the first four bytes    of
the SID file header instead of &quot;PSID&quot;, which allows for safe rejection.
Examples of an RSID format SID include sample tunes which require
real-time sample playback, busy delay loops in real time and
cycle-accurate timing.
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
The RSID format should only be used if the rip will crash older SID
emulators.
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">

documents section of the

[8] Why has HVSC decided to go with PSIDv2NG?</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
The HVSC Team had thought for some time about going with the file
format, as it would allow for better and more accurate rips, being
played with the cycle-accurate Sidplay2 player.  However, such an
issue was important and so in March 2002 HVSC undertook its first ever
user survey, which asked how the collection was used, what the users
found important in a SID file format to them, and whether the
collection should move to PSIDv2NG format.  When you consider that of
those surveyed:
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
* 73% wished for SID files to be played on a real C64 where possible
* 94% would like to hear SID tunes at their intended PAL or NTSC speed
* 91% wished to know which SID chip a SID tune was composed on
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
and that a majority also wished for us to have SID files play more
accurately, and for the collection to go to PSIDv2NG, then it was an
easy decision to make.  Further, <font color="#00FF00">PSIDv2NG is the only new SID file
format thus far that facilitates what was preferred.
</font>
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font color="#00FF00" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><a name="9"></a>
[9] Some of the file names have _PSID and _BASIC in their name. Why is this?</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
- If you use sidplay1, play the _PSID files if they exist.
- If you use sidplay2, play the non-_PSID files.

There were many SIDs ripped where they were hacked for compatibility
or PlaySID extended digi registers, which are specific to older SID
emulators like PlaySID and Sidplay only.   Although Sidplay2 will play
those rips, a real C64 will not and and in most cases it will lock up
with them.

As the collection develops, C64-friendly versions of these rips will
be added which will run alongside the existing PlaySID-specific rips.
Most of these will be in the RSID format which will safely reject on
the older SID emulators.   Further, by marking the PlaySID specific
tunes in this way, that user then knows which rip is suited best to
their SID emulator.

Similarly, those SIDs that are marked BASIC were originally taken
from C64 games which were wholly programmed in the BASIC
language.  To convert these BASIC programs into timer-exact
machine code SID tunes would take not only a lot of effort, but
inevitably you would also lose the accuracy of playback of these
tunes.  Emulation support is now provided by the latest versions
of Sidplay2 to be able to effectively emulate BASIC (and thus
the tunes created within BASIC) correctly.

HVSC 5.7 saw the first BASIC SIDs in the collection, and as the collection
progresses, more of these tunes will appear.</font>

[10] My operating system doesn't yet (or can't) support Sidplay2. Will
       I still be able to play the SIDs in HVSC?</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
Yes. Part of the PSIDv2NG specification is to allow for backwards
compatibility, wherever possible.  The only SIDs you won't be able to
play are those which are real C64 specific, and for the majority of
those, they will have a PlaySID equivalent marked as mentioned above.

[11] When will the next update be released?</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
There is no fixed time schedule as to when each update is released.  Each
update is dependent on two factors: available time and available SIDs.  Once
enough SIDs have been sent in to equal around 1.44 MBs (compressed) and the
HVSC crew has time enough to properly sort the SIDs, the next update will
be released.  At present, it takes on average three months to put together a
new update.  However, you should note that with the amount of SIDs already
present in HVSC, it does become harder to compile updates full of new SIDs and
three months should be seen as an absolute minimum.
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
Also, if you wish to be added to the HVSC Update Announcement list, which
means you get an email the moment the HVSC website is updated announcing the

Note too that you will be able to download the update from two sites on the

[12] Do I have to download all of HVSC after each update?</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
No. The update comes with a tool that automatically updates HVSC to the
next version.  Instructions are provided in each update and within the
tool.  In particular, do NOT run the update tool more than once.

[14] Why do the updates sometimes add SIDs that HVSC already had?</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
We often replace SIDs in HVSC with better versions. Reason for
replacing SIDs could be <font color="#00FF00">(1)</font> more sub-tunes <font color="#00FF00">(2)</font> 100% rip <font color="#00FF00">(3)</font> significantly
smaller <font color="#00FF00">(4)</font> merger of several SIDs. A &quot;100% rip&quot; includes SID tunes
that are <font color="#00FF00">fully C64 compliant</font> and where applicable have all subtunes.
Thus, there is a chance that a new version of a tune could sound identical
to the current version in HVSC.  The new rip, however, has some internal
changes that does in fact make it superior.  Note that occasionally we
do mistakenly add repeated tunes (and please tell us if you spot them.)
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font color="#00FF00" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><a name="15"></a>
[15] After I ran the Update, I can no longer find some SIDs.
     Where did they go?</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
To find out more details as to where SIDs were moved, why they were
deleted, why they were replaced, etc., view the /DOCUMENTS/UpdateXX.hvs
file for the current update.  The &quot;XX&quot; in the path mentioned in the
previous sentence represents the current update number.  So if after
running Update #7 you can no longer find a favorite SID, check
/DOCUMENTS/Update07.hvs and search the file for the location where that
SID was manipulated.  The UpdateXX.hvs file serves as a data file for the
UPDATE tool but is also readable by humanoids and does contain some
comments.  The best way to find the section of the file that contains the
information you seek is to do a string search on the old SID or the path
where the SID resided.

[17] Why should I get HVSC when I can just load up the game/demo and hear
     the music on a real C64?</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
First off, remember that HVSC isn't just for emulator users.  In fact,
the tunes in HVSC are still in raw C64 code only prepended by some header
information.  <a href="http://psid64.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">There now exists a really useful tool called PSID64</a>, which
takes a .sid from HVSC and turns it into a RUNnable C64 .prg file, which
you can load and run on the real thing to play the tune.  The only ones
you can't are those with _PSID in the filename (see <a href="#9">[9]</a> above for more
information) but gradually there'll be real C64 versions of those SIDs, too.
We appreciate that there's still many C64 diehards out there (in fact,
several of the HVSC Crew still compose music on the real thing too.)
hence our wish that all SIDs can be made into a C64 runnable form.
C64 users enjoy HVSC because it is the largest SID collection
on Earth.  It is unlikely that you have all of the programs from where the
SIDs in HVSC originated.  Plus, with HVSC, you can select any level tune at
any time.  SID emulators are getting better all the time, and with
libsidplay2's cycle exact timing, moving onward too.  And for people
who no longer own a C64, SID emulators are a <font color="#00FF00">dream</font>.  Imagine how many C64 
disks you would need to store the whole HVSC on.
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font color="#00FF00" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><a name="18"></a>
[18] Why do some tunes sound different compared to how I remember them on
     the C64?</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
SID emulators are very good, but not perfect.  Although SID emulation
is not perfect, the actual rip of the SID tune may be corrupt.  In addition
to rippers corrupting tunes, crackers would often make mistakes and muck
up the tunes' speed (most infamously, Skate or Die and Driller.)
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
Another common problem is that some people may not be aware of is that
North America (NTSC) and Europe (PAL) had differences in their TVs
that influence the speed of SID tunes that used raster timing.
However, where possible in HVSC SID tunes are now flagged as being PAL or
NTSC so you can now hear them as the composer intended.  You must use
Sidplay2 to take advantage of this feature, otherwise in older SID
emulators you can force the clock speed to PAL or NTSC to hear it as you
remember it.

If you believe you have found a corrupt tune, it would be best if you
load up the old tune on a C64/128 and compare it to the HVSC version.  If you
then notice a problem with the HVSC version, by all means, let us know.  We
strongly recommend that you do not compare the HVSC tune to a tune
played in a C64 emulator, as often it's not accurate.  You might also
want to check out the <a href="http://www.stil.c64.org/" target="_blank">STIL</a> which documents any known problems with the SIDs
found in HVSC if the game or demo also played the SID tune the same way.

<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
This gives a basic guide to the fundamentals of ripping, although
please note that you should <font color="#00FF00">not</font> use the PlaySID extended digi registers
anymore.  All rips should be C64 compliant.
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
Once you've ripped the C64 data (and wherever possible, tested your
ripped data on a real C64) you should use the SIDEdit tool to
convert your rip to PSIDv2NG format for HVSC.  Please use the
<a href="http://lala.c64.org/" target="_blank">
PSIDEdit link at http://lala.c64.org/
</a>
 for more information.
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
However, do not set any of the PSIDv2NG fields unless you are absolutely
sure you are correct.  Consult the documentation with SIDEdit for
more information.
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
You should then use Sidplay2 to test your rip to make sure it works
correctly.
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
One other important thing to bear in mind - if at all possible, rip
from the _original_ release of the game.  The initial wave of game cracks
back in the late 1980s often missed out tunes, mucked up tunes etc and are
never treated as a 100% reliable source for the correct game tunes, just to
be on the safe side.  Also, you will find that the release date given in
a crack can be inaccurate, along with the credits, as the cracker
would often overwrite the correct credits with who cracked the game etc.

[20] Why isn't tune X in HVSC?</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
Of course, not every SID ever made on the C64 is in HVSC.  We feel that
the majority of the most requested tunes are in HVSC.  This does not mean
we feel that almost _all_ C64 tunes are in HVSC.  The HVSC crew is always
busy ripping new SIDs and always receiving more SIDs.  The best thing you
can do if you would like to hear a certain tune in HVSC is to check out
the 
<a href="http://lala.c64.org/" target="_blank">
SID Hunt web page
</a>
 which can be reached from the main HVSC web site.
</font>
</pre>
<pre>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
Also, the 
<a href="http://www.hvsc.c64.org/News/rippedtunes.html">
HVSC Ripped Tunes page
</a>
 is a good source to check if a tune has
<br>
been ripped and due for a HVSC Update.

You may also want to consider <a href="http://gnetools.sourceforge.net/sidbace/" target="_blank">Vincent Voois' &quot;Sidbace 32&quot;</a>

[21] I can't find tune Y in HVSC which was used in an old intro/demo.
     Can you tell me where it is?</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
Unfortunately, many intro coders and programmers failed to properly
give credit to the music they used in their work.  HVSC, thankfully, is very
accurate in the credits it gives.  We have worked for years contacting the
original composers of tunes to help verify SID credits in HVSC.  I don't
think you are going to like what I am leading up to.  C64 musicians have
long been ignored on the C64.  Many people will say, &quot;Do you have the music
to Commando?&quot; not knowing who made the music.  The time has come that you
too should learn these composers' names.  Basically, what I am telling you
is that there is a chance that you will have to roll up your sleeves and dig
through HVSC searching for your old favorite tunes.  Before you do this,
though, you should check out the HVSC search engine at the HVSC web site.
With just a fragment of information, you can perhaps find the tune.  Also,
note that the professional composers (i.e., ones who received money for their
work) are at the root of HVSC.  Some of the lesser known composers and
composers from post-1992 are in the &quot;VARIOUS&quot; directory.  Knowing this
information should help reduce your search time.

For demos, you might wish to pay a visit to Stephan Schmid's excellent

<br>

[22] Why do some of the tunes in HVSC not play?</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
More than likely, a silent tune is a PSID-only tune or the tune isn't
fully C64 compliant.  Our goal is to eventually all these tunes
with versions that will work in the real C64 environment mode
of Sidplay2.  Further, some tunes use ADSR values which the
original Sidplay's libsidplay library does not like.

<pre><font color="#00FF00" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><a name="23"></a>
[23] Why are there some incorrect or ugly-looking credits in HVSC?</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
Slowly but surely we are taking care of this. With each update, we make
at least 200 credit fixes.  So please be patient and if you notice any
incorrect credits, email us and we'll try to fix them for the next update.
Note also that any documented proof you have of the credit fix will help.<br><br>
Some people may not realise the amount of effort that has gone into HVSC
since they have no idea of the collection's history.  The chart below
proudly shows the amount of progress HVSC has made since its existence.
An explanation of the key: <font color="#00FF00">deleted</font> tunes were either damaged or repeated;
<font color="#FF00FF">fixed</font> tunes that replaced inferior rips; <font
color="#FF0000">new</font> is for new SIDs added;
<font color="#0000FF">credits</font> are fixes or additions to current HVSC credits.<br>
<img src="hvsc_graph.gif" width="702" height="366">
<br>The chart shows several things.  Not only does HVSC average over 400 new
SIDs per Update but the collection also averages over 400 credit fixes
per Update.  Also, note how the number of repeats added and the number
of fixed rips have been kept extremely low.  This shows the amount of
quality in the collection.  Eventually we hope that the number of credit
fixes per Update will drop below 200.

[25] How is it determined which composers go under the /VARIOUS dir?</font>
</pre>
<pre>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
The current rule is:
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
 (1) If the artist has no tunes made in 1992 or earlier, go to step #4
 (2) If the artist has game tunes (3 must be made in 1992 or earlier), 
      above Various... else go to step #3
 (3) If the artist was a famous demo composer in 1992 or earlier, above
      Various...else go to step #4
 (4) Below Various
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
Note: Rule (2) above has slightly changed.  This is in order that an
artist who may have produced only one game tune for a magazine covermount
prior to 1992 does not make it above VARIOUS.
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
Also, as of HVSC 3.1, the /VARIOUS directory changed structure.  In order
to make it manageable chunks, /VARIOUS now has four subdirs, A-F, G-L, M-R and
S-Z, so you can look in those to find the composers you seek.

In addition, the HVSC Crew have ensured that any programs distributed on a
HVSC CD have had written permission from the programmers concerned to include
their work, such as Sidplay, PlaySID, APlayer etc.

If you are a public domain library and wish to include HVSC 
on a CD-ROM then please email <a href="mailto:hvsc@spam-suxx!!!c64.org">Stephan Schmid & Peter Sandén</a> for permission -<br>that's all we ask. As long as you are making no profit

One final thing. You may also see C64 compilation CDs (such as the C64
Classix CD) which contain to have &quot;over 10,000 SID tunes&quot;.  They have
copied HVSC onto those CDs without permission and are making profit from
it, which is not only against the HVSC ethic, but also means that 
the composers' works are being abused.

[27] When will HVSC be completed?</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
In all likelihood, never.  Far too many tunes were made on the C64 to
reasonably expect that every SID will be collected.  In addition, people
are still composing music on the C64 to this day (some of the HVSC
team themselves are among them).  Consider HVSC a living collection.

[29] So how do I make my own SID tunes?</font></font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
In most cases, you will need access to either a real C64 or a 
C64 emulator such as CCS64 or VICE.  Ideally it is preferred that you
actually compose on the real thing, as you know the emulation is going
to be 100% :-).  You will also need a music editor program, which will
enable you to easily alter the sequences with the notes in, the voices
that the C64 will use, and also which will let you compile your tunes 
to disk so that they can be loaded and run by other users.
</font>

<a href="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/cbm/c64/audio/editors/" target="_blank">ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/cbm/c64/audio/editors/</a> is a good place to start to
download a Commodore 64 music editor. I would advise you to try out a
few and see which one you prefer.  Over the years many people have
recommended JCH's Editor, Music Assembler, DMC Editor, Future Composer,
Voicetracker, Siduzzit, Soundmonitor and many others, but do take the
time to read all the documentation with them.  They will help you a lot
in creating the right sound for your tune.

Those of you who are used to tracker programs like Fast Tracker on the PC
might like to check out CyberTracker - see <a href="http://noname.c64.org/tracker/" target="_blank">http://noname.c64.org/tracker/</a>
- it's a FT-like environment for making C64 tunes.
</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
And now there's a native PC application which will do the job very
nicely for you.  Lasse &Ouml;&ouml;rni's GoatTracker uses the well known reSID
emulation engine in conjunction with a friendly and simple to use
interface so that within minutes you can be mastering the SID chip
and producing your tunes.  And for HardSID card owners, you can also
use the real C64 SID chip on your HardSID to ensure your sound is as
close to the real thing as possible.  The beauty also is that you can
save your tunes (when finished) to C64 .prg format, or SID format too.

easy to convert to a SID file to send off to the HVSC Crew (hint).

[30] What if I want to release a cover of a SID tune commercially?</font>
</pre>
<pre><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">
You should importantly please bear in mind that often the C64 composer
will own authorship rights to their SID tunes, and not the software company.
This is particularly the case as often known game composers worked freelance
and so kept the ownership to their pieces.  You should endeavour to contact
the original C64 composer to ensure not just permission but also that
the composer gets due authorship credit (and payment of course) on the
record.  Feel free also to contact <a href="mailto:chris@spamsuxx.c64audio.com">Chris Abbott</a>
with regard to this if you are unsure how to proceed.
